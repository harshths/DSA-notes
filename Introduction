🔷 1. What is DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)?

    📌 Data Structure –
        "It is a way to store and organize data in memory, so that we can use it efficiently."

              📚 Examples:
                    Array
                    
                    Linked List
                    
                    Stack
                    
                    Queue
                    
                    Tree
                    
                    Graph
                    
                    HashMap etc.


    📌 Algorithm –
        "It is a step-by-step procedure to solve a particular problem."
        
      📚 Examples:
          Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
          
          Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
          
          Graph traversal (BFS, DFS)
          
          Dynamic Programming etc.


          📦 In short:
                DS → How to store data
                Algo → How to solve problems using that data



      🔥 Real-Life Examples:

                Real-Life Task	      Data Structure	      Algorithm

              Contacts in Phone	       Array/Trie	        Searching/Sorting
              Google Maps	              Graph	           Dijkstra's Algorithm
              Call Stack in Code	      Stack	           Recursion/Backtracking
              Task Scheduling (CPU)	    Queue	         Round Robin/FIFO Algorithm



      🤔 Why DSA is Important?

            Placement me 90% questions DSA pe hote hain
            
            Problem-solving skills sharp ho jate hain
            
            Big tech companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) DSA pe hi focus karte hain
            
            Optimized code likhna seekh jaate ho
            
            System Design samajhne me help karta hai
            
            ⚠️ Without DSA = You are just a typist, not a coder!
